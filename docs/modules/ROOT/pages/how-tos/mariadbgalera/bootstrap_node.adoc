= How to Bootstrap a Cluster (other than from Node 0)

[WARNING]
====
If you bootstrap from any other node than the one that has proceeded the furthest in transactions, this will result in data loss.
Always take a backup of the data directory before taking any further steps.
====

To restart a Galera Cluster, you might need to bootstrap the cluster from another node than 0 (after a ungraceful shutdown).
You can basically follow the steps described in the Helm Chart: https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mariadb-galera/#bootstraping-a-node-other-than-0[Bootstraping a node other than 0].

In order to change Helm Values, you first need to find the Helm release object:

.Get the compositemariadbinstances
[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe compositemariadbinstances.syn.tools f1600418-cf59-4ec0-b4d9-d0270559dbcf
----

This gives you all resources in this composite:

[source,yaml]
----
[...]

The second (Helm) `Release` should be the MariaDB Helm release, in this example it's `f1600418-cf59-4ec0-b4d9-d0270559dbcf-4xp5n`.

.Verify if it's the release of the mariadb-galera cluster
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get releases.helm.crossplane.io f1600418-cf59-4ec0-b4d9-d0270559dbcf-4xp5n

To change values for the safe bootstraping just edit this release and set the values based on your findings (node number to bootstrap from and the `podManagementPolicy`.
As you can't change a `StatefulSet` first delete the mariadb `StatefulSet` and then apply your changes to the release object (this will recreate the `StatefulSet` again).

When your cluster is up and running again (all 3 pods ready), first scale down to 1 replica and wait until only one Pod remains and then scale down to 0 replicas.
This makes sure that you can bootstrap from the first node again:

[source,shell]
----
# Scale to 1 replica
kubectl scale sts mariadb --replicas=1

# Wait
# Scale to 0 replica
kubectl scale sts mariadb --replicas=0
----

Delete the `StatefulSet` again and then reverse your changes in the helm release.
Now the Galera Service should start again without errors.
