= VSHN Based AppCat Services

This page will explain how the VSHN based services will be handled for the usage reporting.
The source metrics for these services are completely under our own control and can be adjusted to fit the new solution.

The current billing model follows closely with the https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/architecture/metering-data-flow-odoo8.html[legacy billing model of APPUiO Cloud itself].
The necessary metrics are fed into Prometheus/Mimir and then processed via further tooling.
Based on that, we can adapt to the new Prometheus/Mimir workflows.

We will keep using Prometheus Recording Rules.
They serve a few purposes:

* Aligning the metrics, so every AppCat Service produces exactly the same without any additional configuration
* Reduce the amount of metrics sent to Mimir
* Simplify the queries needed in the https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/references/architecture/metering-data-flow-appuio-cloud.html#_data_flow_overview[later data flow process].
