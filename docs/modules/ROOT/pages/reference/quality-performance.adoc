== Each Service Enforces Contraints
Source::
User

Stimulus::
Provision an AppCatalog Service instance with an invalid spec

Environment::
AppCatalog enabled Kubernetes cluster

Artifact::
`kubectl` or equivalent tool

Response::
The provisioning of the service instance fails with an message containing the reason why the provisioning fails.

Response measure::
The provisioning is aborted.

Rationale::
Services with excessive resource usage or special configurations aren't commercially reasonable.
Each service must document and enforce constraints that limit the resources and impact of abnormal conditions so that the user cannot use it out of certain boundaries.
