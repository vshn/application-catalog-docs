= Provisioning Time

Source::
User

Stimulus::
Orders a service via the provided APIs.

Environment::
AppCatalog enabled Kubernetes cluster ("Converged Cluster")

Artifact::
`kubectl` or equivalent tool

Response::
Service ready (status condition)

Response measure::
Service ready depending on service architecture in normal conditions:
- Standalone: within 10 minutes
- Replicated: within 20 minutes
- Clustered: within 30 minutes

Rationale::
The user can work with the instance in an acceptable time frame.

[NOTE]
====
- The provided APIs can vary according to the environment.
- The service is provisioned asynchronously and its readiness status has to be polled regularly.
- Services with Cloud Instance architecture type are excluded and they take as long as needed.
