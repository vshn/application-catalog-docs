= Backups Can Be Exported

Source::
Service engineer

Stimulus::
Export an existing backup

Environment::
AppCatalog enabled Kubernetes cluster

Artifact::
K8up and restic

Response::
The backup is in a format that can be exported.

Response measure::
The backup data can be inspected and used to fully restore a service instance outside of AppCat with conventional tools.

Rationale::
Vendor lock-in users into the service instances or AppCat framework must be avoided.
The users should be able to take their data away before canceling their service instances.
