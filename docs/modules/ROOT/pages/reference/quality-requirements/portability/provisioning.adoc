= Common Interface to Provision Services

Source::
User

Stimulus::
Creates an AppCatalog Service

Environment::
AppCatalog enabled Kubernetes cluster

Artifact::
`kubectl` or equivalent tool

Response::
The services are provisioned using the supported provisioning methods for any cluster.

Response measure::
The usage for provisioning services is transparent for any underlying Kubernetes distribution.
The same API calls and CRs can be used to provision AppCatalog services.

Rationale::
`kubectl` and equivalent tools shall provide the common means for interacting with the AppCatalog framework.
In general it doesn't matter where the platform is running on, although there may be cloud provider specific APIs.
