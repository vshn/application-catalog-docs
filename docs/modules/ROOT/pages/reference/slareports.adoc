= AppCat SLA Reports

Currently the SLA reports for AppCat are generated on the first of each month and stored in an S3 bucket on objects.lpg.cloudscale.ch.
The bucket name is `appcat-sla-reports`. The credentials for the objectBucket are available in the namespace `syn-appcat-slos` on APPUiO Cloud.

The bucket contains a folder for each year and month.
Within those folders are PDFs in the format of $organization.pdf.
If for some reason there's SLO data for instances that don't have an organizaton set, they are collected in a PDFs called `noOrganizationName.pdf`.
