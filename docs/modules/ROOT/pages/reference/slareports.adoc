= AppCat SLA Reports

Currently, the SLA reports for AppCat are generated on the first day of each month and are stored in an S3 bucket.
The bucket is provisioned by an AppCat `objectBucket` in the `syn-appcat-slos` namespace on APPUiO Cloud lpg-2.

The bucket contains a folder for each year and month.
Within those folders are PDFs in the format of $organization.pdf.
If for some reason there's SLO data for instances that don't have an organizaton set, they are collected in a PDFs called `noOrganizationName.pdf`.
