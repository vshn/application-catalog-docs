Stimulus::
Changes the manifest of an {product} service.

Environment::
{product} enabled Kubernetes cluster

Artifact::
`kubectl` or equivalent tool

Response::
Service instance configuration is changed according to desired state using the supported provisioning methods.

Response measure::
Observed service instance state is updated in the manifest.

Rationale::
Service instance provisioning (complete stack) should be as user-friendly as deploying a custom application in Kubernetes with GitOps in mind.
This gives users a native Kubernetes experience by using `kubectl` and equivalent tools.
