:page-aliases: reference/quality-requirements.adoc

These pages contain the formal quality requirements that apply to the {product} framework.
They are general descriptions, for specific services please see the service specification.

////
Note for future "best practices"
- We should lower the operational load by using good Kubernetes health checks
- In a shared cloud environment, it is crucial to secure the services, so no other people have access to it (TLS + auth)
- Provide connection details Secret in the app namespace
- Service API shall not use plaintext secrets (use Secret reference instead)
