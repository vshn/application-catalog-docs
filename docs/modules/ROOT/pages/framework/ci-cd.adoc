= CI/CD Processes
:page-aliases: reference/ci-cd.adoc

AppCat contains many repositories.
They all converge in the `component-appcat`, which is responsible for deploying everything.

In order to streamline our development process, we improved the CI/CD with following steps:

* Creating a PR in an AppCat repository automatically builds images and packages
* Creating a PR in an AppCat repository automatically creates a PR on the component that reflects the changes, so it can instantly be deployed any SYN cluster to test
* Proper labels on the PRs are enforced
* Merging a PR will automatically create a release, according to the labels it will detect what version increment it needs to do
* The auto release is not active on the component repository

== How to manage the CI/CD pipelines

All the files that specify the process are managed via cruft and cookiecutter.
The repository is: https://github.com/vshn/appcat-cookiecutter.
Each of the AppCat repos contains a cronjob that checks for changes every 60 minutes.
If there are changes it will open a new PR.

== AppCat Deployment

Deployment of AppCat is not the same as releasing a new version of the framework to services.

With Crossplane composition functions, multiple versions can be deployed simultaneously in the cluster.

* These functions run in parallel and remain mostly idle until a composite (service) uses them.
* This enables a fine-grained release process at the level of each individual instance.
* Each instance can run any of the available AppCat versions present in the cluster at that time.

A new version is deployed when a new tag is created in the `component-appcat` repository.

* In test clusters, deployment happens instantly.
* In production, it occurs after a one-week delay.
* The dependency is updated automatically via the `commodore-defaults` repository using Renovate.

== AppCat Release

The release process refers to a service starting to use a newer composition revision with a higher revision number.

* The upgrade is triggered automatically during a service maintenance window.
* The latest available revision is selected during maintenance, even if intermediate versions exist.
* An upgrade can also be triggered manually by running the maintenance job for a specific instance.

== AppCat Rollback

Currently, rollback must be performed manually for each service instance.

* This involves updating the claimâ€™s `spec.compositionRevisionRef.name` field to the desired AppCat version.
* The process is manual.
* In the near future, **Schedar** will implement automatic rollback capabilities:
** Per service instance
** Per service type
** Per cluster

== Hotfix

Hotfixes are special jobs that update the composition revision reference in composites.

* A hotfix is triggered for a specific version in the `component-appcat` repository using the format:
+
`appcat.deploymentManagementSystem.hotfix=<component-version>-<appcat-version>`
+
* The specified version must match an existing composition revision.
* If no match is found, the hotfix jobs will not apply any changes.

== Automated AppCat CI

There are automated workflows in place in AppCat repository that should streamline our development between AppCat and Component repositories.

=== Releases from AppCat

The release has to be manually dispatched, usually before the end of the sprint, on Tuesday.
The following is the lifecycle of the release process:
