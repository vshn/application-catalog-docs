:navtitle: Service User

Service Users are end customers who provision and use services via the Servala portal.
They need visibility into their running instances without direct cluster access.

== Requirements

As a Service User I can:

* Access service-specific metrics (CPU, memory, connections, throughput)
* View application logs for troubleshooting
* Understand current and projected costs
* Retrieve credentials and endpoints easily
* See real-time service health and SLI indicators
