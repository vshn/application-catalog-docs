:navtitle: Service Operator

Service Operators manage service instances across all tenants.
They troubleshoot issues, perform maintenance, and respond to incidents with cluster-wide visibility and control.

== Requirements

As a Service Operator I can:

* Monitor all instances with cluster-wide visibility of health, SLI metrics, and alerts
* Access the cluster directly with kubectl for investigation and remediation
* View comprehensive composite status showing health, errors, and resource states
* Route alerts to incident management with runbook links for standardized response
* Follow service-specific troubleshooting procedures documented in runbooks
* Coordinate upgrades during maintenance windows
* Restore service instances from backups when needed
* Execute emergency procedures during incidents
