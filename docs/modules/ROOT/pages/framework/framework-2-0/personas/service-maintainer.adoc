= Service Maintainer
:navtitle: Service Maintainer

Service Maintainers add new services and define their configuration.
They work exclusively in KCL - no Go code changes needed.

== Requirements

As a Service Maintainer I can:

* Add Helm-based services without touching Go code
* Define static configuration (SLA, chart versions, images, scheduling, backup policies) compiled at build time
* Define dynamic configuration (API parameters) for runtime customization - version selection, custom settings, backup schedules
* Map both static and dynamic configuration to Helm chart values
* Provide observability definitions using framework-provided templates for metrics, dashboards, and alerts
* Test service configuration and lifecycle before deployment
* Maintain a single source of truth in KCL that drives CRD/XRD and service configuration objects to avoid drift
