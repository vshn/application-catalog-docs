[NOTE]
.Summary
====
Framework 2.0 uses a five-layer testing strategy: Go unit tests, integration tests for composition function pipelines, https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/cli/command-reference/#render[Crossplane beta renderer] diffs, https://kyverno.github.io/chainsaw/latest/[Chainsaw] end-to-end tests on ephemeral clusters before release/tag, and targeted golden tests for critical paths.
====

== Overview

Framework 2.0 requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability across:

* Composition function logic (Go code)
* Service configuration validation (KCL)
* Full service lifecycle (create, update, delete, backup, restore)
* Regression testing for configuration changes

The testing strategy consists of five complementary layers, each addressing different testing needs and personas.

== Testing Layers

=== Layer 1: Go Unit Tests

**Responsible Persona:** Framework Engineers

**Tool:** Go testing framework (`testing` package)

**Coverage:**

* Composition function logic
* Helm value rendering
* Custom resource input object loading and parsing
* Connection detail handling
* All other managed resources during composition function life-cycle

**Advantages:**

* *Fast*: No cluster needed, runs in milliseconds
* *Focused*: Tests specific logic units
* *Easy to Debug*: Direct Go debugging with breakpoints
* *CI-Friendly*: Quick feedback in pull requests

**Disadvantages:**

* Limited to testing individual function logic in isolation
* Cannot validate interactions between multiple composition functions

=== Layer 2: Integration Tests

**Responsible Persona:** Framework Engineers

**Tool:** Crossplane function runner or Go integration tests with mock Crossplane pipeline

**Purpose:** Test interactions between multiple composition functions in a pipeline, validating data flow, resource dependencies, and function orchestration without requiring a live cluster.

**Coverage:**

* Multiple composition functions in sequence
* Data passing between composition functions (context, connection details)
* Resource dependency ordering
* Pipeline-level error handling
* Shared resource mutations across functions
* Composition function chain behavior

**Advantages:**

* *No Cluster Needed*: Fast feedback without infrastructure
* *Pipeline Validation*: Tests realistic function interactions
* *Framework-Focused*: Validates composition architecture
* *CI-Friendly*: Faster than e2e, more realistic than unit tests
* *Debugging*: Can inspect intermediate pipeline states

**Disadvantages:**

* More complex setup than unit tests
* Requires maintaining realistic pipeline configurations
* Doesn't test actual Kubernetes API interactions
* Need cumbersome testing fixtures to emulate Crossplane grpc requests

=== Layer 3: Crossplane Beta Renderer Diffs

**Responsible Persona:** Service Maintainers

**Tool:** https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/cli/command-reference/#render[Crossplane beta renderer] (pipeline mode) with diffing

**Purpose:** Render composition function output without a live cluster and produce diffs against expected resources, catching rendering regressions early.

**Coverage:**

* Composition function output objects (HelmRelease, ServiceMonitor, secrets, extra resources)
* KCL-compiled configuration inputs and parameter permutations
* Detection of unintended resource additions/removals/field changes

**Advantages:**

* *No Cluster Needed*: Fast feedback, ideal for PR checks
* *Deterministic Diffs*: Surfaces drift in rendered resources before e2e
* *Service Maintainer Friendly*: Works directly from KCL outputs and inputs
* *Crossplane-Aligned*: Uses Crossplane-provided renderer and helpers

=== Layer 4: End-to-End Tests

**Responsible Persona:** Service Maintainers and Framework Engineers

**Tool:** https://kyverno.github.io/chainsaw/latest/[Chainsaw]

**Why Chainsaw over KUTTL:**

* Better error messages and assertions
* Maintained by Kyverno team (active development)
* Declarative test scenarios (YAML-based)
* Built-in cleanup steps
* Improved resource matching and waiting

**Coverage:**

* Service creation (composite ready)
* Helm Release verification
* Connection secret creation
* Billing Service management
* Service upgrade (chart version change)
* Service deletion (cleanup)
* Upgrade tests
* Regression tests
* Connection tests (already exist)
* Other Day 2 operations tests

**Example Test:**

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: chainsaw.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: Test
metadata:
  name: redis-test
spec:
  steps:
  # Step 1: Create Redis claim
  - try:
    - apply:
        file: redis-claim.yaml
    - assert:
        file: redis-claim-assert.yaml

  # Step 2: Verify Helm Release created
  - try:
    - assert: {}

  # Step 3: Verify connection secret
  - try:
    - assert:
        resource: {}

  # Cleanup
  - try:
    - delete: {}
----

**Advantages:**

* *Real Cluster*: Tests actual Crossplane behavior, Helm rendering
* *Full Lifecycle*: Validates end-to-end flow
* *Declarative*: Straight forward to write and maintain by Service Maintainers
* *CI Integration*: Can run in Kind cluster in GitHub Actions during CI (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJiczJH0=/?moveToWidget=3458764652887798727&cot=14[further evaluation is necessary])

=== Layer 5: Golden Tests

**Responsible Persona:** Service Maintainers and Framework Engineers

**Tool:** https://www.kcl-lang.io/[KCL] + Make targets + diff

**Purpose:** Detect unintended manifest changes when KCL configuration changes.

**Use Cases:**

* Validate KCL compilation doesn't break
* Catch unintended changes in generated manifests (for example, namespace changed accidentally)
* Run in PR checks for fast feedback
* Validate multiple overrides, especially in cluster catalog generations (profiles)

**Advantages:**

* *Fast*: No cluster needed
* *Regression Detection*: Catches accidental manifest changes
* *CI-Friendly*: Quick validation in pull requests
* *Hierarchy*: Testing multiple overrides, especially in cluster catalog generations (profiles)

**Disadvantages:**

* *High Maintenance*: Need to update golden files on every intentional change
* *Brittle*: Can fail on formatting changes
* *Doesn't Test Behavior*: Only validates static output

**Usage Recommendation:**

Use golden tests on specific cases - for validating https://www.kcl-lang.io/[KCL] compilation only.

* Use golden tests for critical paths like service, platform or distribution configurations
* Update golden files as part of intentional changes

== Testing Approach Summary

The five-layer testing strategy provides comprehensive coverage:

1. *Go Unit Tests* (primary) - Test composition function logic
2. *Integration Tests* - Test composition function pipeline interactions
3. *Crossplane Beta Renderer Diffs* - Validate rendered resources without a cluster
4. *Chainsaw End-to-End Tests* (critical paths) - Test full service lifecycle
5. *Golden Tests* (specific cases) - Validate KCL compilation

=== Benefits

1. *Fast Feedback*: Go unit tests, integration tests, and renderer diffs run in CI for every commit, catching logic, pipeline, and rendering errors early without a cluster.

2. *Pipeline Validation*: Integration tests bridge the gap between isolated unit tests and full e2e tests, validating composition function interactions and data flow without cluster overhead.

3. *Real Validation*: Chainsaw tests validate actual Crossplane behavior, Helm rendering, K8s API interactions.

4. *Renderer Diffs*: Crossplane beta renderer provides deterministic diffs to spot unintended resource changes before e2e runs.

5. *Golden Tests*: Lightweight addition for catching accidental manifest changes, but not primary testing.
