[NOTE]
.Summary
====
Our current CI system no longer aligns with the updated release process, particularly in supporting independent handling of hotfixes and feature requests.
The Gitflow workflow has been selected as the branching model for our CI pipeline.
====

== Problem Statement

=== Hotfix Release Cycle

Currently, hotfix pull requests are often entangled with new feature development in the `master` branch.
This results in the unintended deployment of new features alongside urgent hotfixes.
While this was previously manageable, the recent need to minimize downtime has made this practice unsustainable.

We need a solution that enables hotfixes to be deployed independently, while deferring feature releases to scheduled maintenance windows.

== Existing Workflow: Trunk-Based Development

Trunk-based development encourages small, frequent changes merged directly into a central `master` branch.
This model promotes rapid integration and minimizes merge conflicts, which aligns well with continuous integration goals.

However, the current approach is proving problematic for handling hotfix releases under our new xref:ROOT:adr/0030-function-revisions.adoc[CD process].

=== Attempted Hotfix Solutions

*Forking hotfixes from tags instead of `master`:*

- No change needed to current CI.
- Ensures hotfixes are isolated from ongoing feature work.
- Requires hotfixes to be merged back into `master` later.
- Tags can be difficult to track and manage effectively.
- Risk of deploying a tag that lacks the latest hotfix.

*Using feature flags in AppCat:*

- High implementation cost.
- Adds complexity to the AppCat framework.
- Treats a CI pipeline problem as an application concernâ€”violates separation of concerns.

== Proposed Workflow: Gitflow

Gitflow is a branching strategy that separates feature development, hotfixes, and production releases. It introduces distinct branches for features, releases, and hotfixes, which better supports controlled deployments.

=== `master` Branch

- Represents production-ready code.
- All production tags originate here.
- No direct development occurs on this branch.
- Hotfixes and release-ready features are merged into `master`.

=== `develop` and Feature Branches

- All new features branch off from `develop`.
- Once a feature is complete and tested, it is merged back into `develop`.
- Features are promoted to `master` only during planned releases.

=== `hotfix` Branches

- Created directly from `master` to address urgent production issues.
- Merged into both `master` (for immediate deployment) and `develop` (to preserve history).
- Provides an isolated path for emergency changes.

=== Benefits of Gitflow for Hotfixes

- Hotfixes are isolated from feature development.
- Releases become predictable and manageable.
- Enables CI/CD to support both rapid patches and stable, scheduled deployments.

== Decision

Adopt the Gitflow model and update the CI pipeline accordingly:

. Create hotfix branches from `master` as needed.
. Merge hotfixes into both `master` and `develop`.
. Use `develop` for all ongoing feature work.
. Merge `develop` into `master` only during release cycles.

*Trade-offs:*

- More complex CI configuration.
- Clean separation of emergency and planned releases.
- Solves current pain point with minimal risk of feature leakage during hotfixes.
