.Summary
====
For sending billing events to Odoo (https://docs.central.vshn.ch/event-billing.html[Event Based Billing^]), will use the existing AppCat controller to manage billing events and Kubernetes CRDs as the persistence mechanism.
====

== Requirements

. Reuse existing tools and/or components of AppCat to build a resilient event-based billing solution.
. Make data resending to Odoo possible in case it's required (historical record retention is required).
. Persist the state of each billing request.
. Do not block service creation, deletion, or update due to errors in the billing system.
. [[odoo-sync-state]] Provide a way to verify sync state between Odoo and the Kubernetes cluster.
. Do not lose any event (created, deleted, scaled), as this has a direct financial impact.

== Solution Options

After careful evaluation, the two most promising solutions for implementing event-based billing are:

. <<AppCat Controller>>
. <<Runtime Library via Crossplane Composition Functions>>

=== AppCat Controller

Transitioning from metered to event-based billing requires leveraging Kubernetes controllers more extensively.
Our existing AppCat controller already handles event forwarding and webhooks, making it a natural candidate for integrating billing logic.

Pros::

* Full control over the lifecycle of VSHN custom resource services.
* Customizable retry logic.
* Clear separation of concerns between billing and service management.
* Flexible support for different persistence backends.


=== Runtime Library via Crossplane Composition Functions

We can embed billing logic into our existing runtime library for Crossplane Composition Functions, thereby coupling service lifecycle events directly with billing logic.

Pros::

* Reconciliation happens directly during create, update, or delete operations.
* Billing logic is treated as a first-class part of provisioning/deprovisioning.

Cons::

* Persistence integration becomes more complex.
* No clear separation between billing and service logic.
* Unclear where billing actually occurs, which can reduce maintainability.
* We can't actually react on deletion events. Crossplane doesn't propagate them to the functions.

== Persistence Options

Based on past experience, we anticipate the need to resend older data to Odoo due to potential issues either in AppCat or Odoo.
A lightweight, reliable mechanism to store and replay billing data is essential.

Required capabilities:

* Filtering and querying historical events.
* Manual replay.
* Partial delivery of historical events.
* Operational simplicity

=== SQLite

SQLite is a simple, embedded SQL database engine suitable for local persistence needs.

Pros::

* Minimal setup; no external infrastructure required.
* Fast for local and sequential read/write operations.
* Full SQL support.
* ACID-compliant (supports WAL mode).
* Self-contained `.db` file that's easy to handle and back up.
* Supports pagination and filtering by retry state or timestamp.

Cons::

* Not suitable for concurrent writes across multiple pods.
* Requires manual effort for backups, failover, and compaction.
* Not distributed or highly available.
* Lacks integration with Kubernetes tools like `kubectl`.
* Not inherently event-driven.

=== Custom Kubernetes CRDs

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) can be used to model billing events as native Kubernetes objects.

Pros::

* Native integration with Kubernetes and observable via `kubectl`.
* Supports event-driven architectures through controllers.
* State tracking via `.status` fields.
* Reusable by other tools/controllers within the cluster.
* Scales horizontally (no single-writer limitation).

Cons::

* Excessive CR volume may cause etcd bloat, impacting cluster performance.
* Increased API server traffic.
* Requires boilerplate for CRD definitions and status handling.
* No native support for complex queries (unlike SQL).
* Manual schema migration is necessary.
* No built-in audit trail beyond resource versioning.

== Decision

=== Use Controller + Custom Kubernetes CRD

The recommendation is to extend the existing AppCat controller to manage event-based billing and using Kubernetes CRDs as the persistence mechanism.

*Justification:*

* A controller is the natural place for billing, as it sits adjacent to service lifecycle management without coupling to it.
* CRDs integrate well into our Kubernetes-native toolset and align with GitOps principles.
* Data inspection and interaction via `kubectl` is simple and consistent with existing workflows.
* While CRs are harder to query than SQL databases, we can mitigate this by providing predefined `kubectl` query templates for common tasks.
* Kubernetes retry mechanisms can be leveraged for automatic re-delivery of failed events.
* By using `patch` operations on CRs, we can flag specific events for manual resending to Odoo.
* With careful CRD schema design (example: using one CR per service instead of one per event), we can avoid overwhelming etcd.
* If detailed auditing is needed, it can be delegated to an external logging or database system.

This hybrid approach gives us robust control, observability, and operational flexibility for event-based billing with minimal compromise.

=== Billing Custom Resource (CR)

Each Billing Custom Resource (CR) describes a single service instance and its full lifecycle - from creation to deletion.

It consists of two main sections:

1. **Static data** - Defined under `.spec.odoo`. These values remain constant throughout the service's lifecycle.
2. **Dynamic data** - Defined under `.status.events`. This section evolves over time, reflecting lifecycle changes such as scaling actions or SLA updates.

All lifecycle events (creation, scaling, deletion) are recorded within the same resource, enabling full event history reconstruction.
This also allows operations such as **resending** events via annotations.

The `.status.events` array must be ordered in **descending** order by `timestamp`, with the most recent event listed first.

Event resending is supported automatically and includes an **exponential backoff retry mechanism**.

All CRs will be created within a single, dedicated namespace.

This design provides better isolation and aligns with the Kubernetes and Crossplane direction of deprecating cluster-scoped resources.
Scoping CRs to a namespace offers several advantages:

* Enables referencing other namespaced resources like ConfigMaps, if required in the future.
* Simplifies access control and resource lifecycle management.
* Keeps CRs co-located with their controller, which also runs in the same namespace.

Centralizing CRs in one namespace enhances organization, improves security, and promotes operational simplicity.

A resource is considered `Synced` only when **all** `.status.events[].state` values are `sent`.

Because it can track multiple products per instance, a configurable limit per product should be implemented.

<1> An on-demand trigger to resend events from the `status.events` list based on their `state`.
<2> Unique name of the composite - serves as the identifier for the Billing CR.
<3> All Billing CRs reside in the `syn-appcat` - framework's management namespace.
<4> A finalizer from the controller to protect from accidental deletion.
<5> The field defines after how many days the CR should be deleted after the service is removed.
<6> The `spec.odoo` section contains static metadata, consistent across all events.
<7> The ID needs to be unique for each instance, using the composite name ensures this uniqueness.
<8> List of products belonging to this instance.
<9> `spec.value` for a generic naming, as not all product quantities can be described as a size.
<10> Events track the state of each of the products associated.

====
Odoo currently provides REST API endpoints that can be used to check sync status between Billing CRs and Odoo.

This will be addressed in a future iteration of the AppCat Billing System.
