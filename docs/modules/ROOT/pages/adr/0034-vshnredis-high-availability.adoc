[NOTE]
.Summary
====
This ADR evaluates different Redis HA deployment options on Kubernetes to support a production-grade, fault-tolerant Redis setup. The goal is to ensure high availability, resilience to node failures, and ease of management/operations.
====

== Context

Requirements to the Redis HA architecture:

* Minimizes downtime during failover
* Supports Kubernetes-native patterns
* Is operationally manageable
* Is compatible with our existing infrastructure and client usage patterns

=== Considered Options

Option 1:  Redis Sentinel + Redis Master/Replica::

* Description: Traditional Redis HA using Sentinel to monitor and promote replicas when the master fails.
* Pros:
  ** Well-established model
  ** Supported by Redis directly
  ** Easy to deploy and manage with the Bitnami Helm chart
  ** Supports Kubernetes-native patterns
* Cons:
  ** Requires client that supports sentinel
  ** Can't be used when exposing Redis outside of Kubernetes (for example Loadbalancer service) and therefore can't be used by Servala.

Option 2: Redis Cluster Mode::

* Description: Redis Cluster offers built-in sharding and high availability with multiple masters and replicas.
* Pros:
  ** Native Redis HA and scalability
  ** No need for Sentinel
* Cons:
  ** Requires client-side cluster awareness
  ** Higher operational complexity: need to manage multiple masters and replicas

Option 3: Redis Master/Replica with TCP Proxy in Front (for example HAProxy, Envoy)::

image::adr-0034-redis-sentinel-haproxy.png[Redis Master/Replica & Sentinel & HAProxy Example]

* Description: Deploy Redis in master-replica mode, expose the Redis master behind a TCP load balancer or proxy that can detect failure and route to the promoted master.
* Pros:
  ** No need for Sentinel
  ** Client remains unaware of master failover; proxy handles redirection
  ** Greater flexibility in failover and health checks
  ** Can be exposed outside of Kubernetes (for example Loadbalancer service) and therefore be used by Servala
* Cons:
  ** Requires custom failover scripts or integration with Sentinel to update routes
  ** Slight increase in latency due to proxy hop
  ** Operational complexity: proxy config must track Redis role changes

Option 4: Redis Master/Replica with Label-based Service Selector and Custom Controller::

image::adr-0034-redis-sentinel-controller.png[Redis Master/Replica & Sentinel & Custom Controller Example]
* Description: Deploy Redis in master-replica mode, expose the Redis master using a Kubernetes Service that selects pods based on a label indicating the master role. A custom controller watches Redis Sentinel to identify the current master and updates pod labels accordingly.
* Pros:
  ** Kubernetes-native solution using native Service abstraction
  ** No additional proxy layer, fully transparent for clients
  ** Stable DNS name always points to the master node
  ** Simplifies failover for clients that are not Sentinel-aware
  ** Can be exposed outside of Kubernetes (for example Loadbalancer service) and therefore be used by Servala
* Cons:
  ** Requires development and maintenance of a custom controller
  ** Controller needs robust error handling to maintain correct labels during Sentinel failover events
  ** Slight failover lag depending on Sentinel detection + label update speed
  ** Complexity shifts from proxy configuration to controller logic


== Decision

Option 1 and 3: They are simpler alternatives that can be implemented more easily.
We can even use both options at the same time by using a flag if we want to enable a proxy in front of Redis.

This gives us the flexibility to support users that have sentinel support in their application as well as the users that don't.
Furthermore, with Option 3 we ensure that the service is also usable with Servala, where the service is exposed publicly.

Last but not least, Options 1 and 3 make it also easy to migrate from HA to non-HA and vice versa. With Option 2 this is not easily doable, as the data is spread across different masters.

Option 2: Redis Cluster Mode is too complex for our use case at the moment as it requires multiple masters and replicas. It's also not straight-forward to switch between non-clustered and clustered mode.

== Consequences

* We need an additional flag to enable a proxy in front of Redis.
* We need to develop and test failover detection and dynamic re-routing logic in the proxy.
