= Working with ADRs

As decided in xref:adr/0001-architecture-decision-records.adoc[], we use ADRs.
This page helps to work with ADRs.

== Creating a new ADR

TIP: You need https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/[Cookiecutter^] to use the provided templates and it's highly recommended to have https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit^] ready and the Git hooks installed with `pre-commit install`.

. Run `cookiecutter templates` in the root directory of the cloned https://github.com/vshn/application-catalog-docs[documentation repository^]
. Fill in the missing pieces (ADR number should automatically be the next free)
. Edit the ADR in the created file

== ADR Index

The ADR index at `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/adr/index.adoc` is automatically generated in a Git https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit^] hook, which calls `hack/adr-tool.py generate`.
