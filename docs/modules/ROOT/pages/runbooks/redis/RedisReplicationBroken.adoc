= Alert rule: RedisReplicationBroken

== icon:glasses[] Overview

This will check if the replication between a Redis master and Redis slave is broken for more than 5 minutes and therefore no data replication could be done.

== icon:bug[] Steps for Debugging

Check the replication state between of the Redis slaves and masters.

=== Check Replication

Check the replication information for every replication.
