= Alert rule: MySQLGaleraClusterDown

== icon:glasses[] Overview

Checks if a Galera Cluster is down.
This could be caused by full PVC, OOM event, network issues or underlying infrastructure issues.

== icon:bug[] Steps for Debugging

See xref:how-tos/mariadbgalera/debug.adoc[How to debug MariaDB Galera] on how to determine the cluster status and specifically xref:how-tos/mariadbgalera/bootstrap_cluster.html[Boostrap a cluster] on how to bring the cluster back up.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure you boostrap from the *last* healthy pod. There are multiple options to find the last healthy pod:

- Create a debug mariadb to mount the PVC and follow these https://mariadb.com/kb/en/galera-cluster-recovery/[instructions].

====

IMPORTANT: If the cluster is down, due to full PVC storage, you first have to resize the underlying PVC.
This needs to be done by the customer, by choosing a higher instance tier.
