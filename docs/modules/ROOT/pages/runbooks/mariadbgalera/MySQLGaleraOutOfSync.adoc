= Alert rule: MySQLGaleraOutOfSync

== icon:glasses[] Overview

This alert is being triggered if a Galera Cluster node is out of Sync for the past 5 minutes.

More specifically, it's `wsrep_local_state` is not `4` ("Synced"). Possible values and their meaning:

* `1` - **Joining** (requesting/receiving State Transfer) - node is joining the cluster
* `2` - **Donor/Desynced** - node is the donor to the node joining the cluster
* `3` - **Joined** - node has joined the cluster
* `4` - **Synced** - node is synced with the cluster

== icon:bug[] Steps for Debugging

See xref:how-tos/mariadbgalera/debug.adoc[How to debug MariaDB Galera] on how to determine the cluster status.

=== State `2 != 4` but sync completed

If a node stays in State `2` for a long time, restart the pod.
