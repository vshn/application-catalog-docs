=== One Pod in CrashLoopBackoff

Sometimes it may happen that data of one of the nodes becomes corrupted.

If, and ONLY IF `mariadb_state` shows that the remaining two nodes are synced, operational and have the same state_uuid's, clear the data dir of the broken pod.

This can be facilitated by recreating the volume:

[source,shell]
----
# Values in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE have to be substituted by the reader!

# Delete the PVC of the broken container:
kubectl delete pvc data-mariadb-N

# Restart the broken pod so that a new PVC is created:
kubectl delete pod mariadb-N
----

Once this has completed, wait for the PVC to be recreated and the Pod to come up again.
