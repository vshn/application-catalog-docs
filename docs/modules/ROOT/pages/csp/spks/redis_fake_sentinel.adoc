= Redis Fake Sentinel with HAProxy
:page-aliases: explanations/redis_fake_sentinel.adoc

We combine the xref:explanations/redis_sentinel_lb_with_haproxy.adoc[HAProxy for Redis Sentinel load-balancing approach] with the fake Sentinel. This is used so that existing applications which require a Sentinel to connect to and query for the master instance are supported without any changes on client side.

The idea is to provide a single IP on which one port (`6379`) always routes to the current Redis master instance and another port (`26379`) routes to a fake Sentinel instance which will always return the aforementioned IP as master.

== Example Configuration

The test setup was done using the https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis[Bitnami Redis Helm Chart] using the following values:

[source,yaml]
----
password: VERYS3CUR3
usePasswordFile: true
 
cluster:
  slaveCount: 3
 
sentinel:
  enabled: true
  downAfterMilliseconds: 3000
  failoverTimeout: 5000
  staticID: true
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 50m
      memory: 8Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 16Mi
 
slave:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 1Gi
      cpu: 100m
    limits:
      memory: 1Gi
      cpu: 500m

For the HAProxy and Sentinel deployment, the https://github.com/appuio/charts/tree/master/haproxy[APPUiO HAProxy Helm Chart] was used as a base and extended with the HAProxy config from xref:explanations/redis_sentinel_lb_with_haproxy.adoc[HAProxy for Redis-Sentinel LoadBalancing] and a Sentinel sidecar:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: sentinel
  image: docker.io/bitnami/redis-sentinel:6.0.9-debian-10-r14
  env:
  - name: REDIS_MASTER_SET
    value: fake
  - name: REDIS_MASTER_PASSWORD
    value: 'fake-password'
  - name: REDIS_MASTER_HOST
    value: 'redis-access-haproxy.redis-sentinel-test.ext.cluster.local'
  - name: REDIS_SENTINEL_QUORUM
    value: '1'
  - name: REDIS_SENTINEL_DOWN_AFTER_MILLISECONDS
    value: '604800000'
  - name: REDIS_SENTINEL_FAILOVER_TIMEOUT
    value: '604800000'
  ports:
  - name: sentinel
    containerPort: 26379
  securityContext:
    privileged: false
    runAsUser: 10001
----

Setting a fake password in the `REDIS_MASTER_PASSWORD` env var prevents this fake Sentinel from reconfiguring the Redis master and slave instances.
Additionally it's important to use another master group name (`fake`) in the fake Sentinel to not interfere with the real group name (`mymaster`).
The high values for down-after and failover-timeout are chosen because there's no failover to be done by this Sentinel anyway.

Using the `k8s_external` CoreDNS plugin we can even use a DNS name that resolves to the LoadBalancer IP: https://coredns.io/plugins/k8s_external/.
In this test the zone `ext.cluster.local` was configured on the cluster's CoreDNS config (ConfigMap `kube-system/coredns`):
