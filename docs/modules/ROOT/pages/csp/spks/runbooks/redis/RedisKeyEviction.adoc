= Alert rule: RedisKeyEviction
:page-aliases: runbooks/redis/RedisKeyEviction.adoc

== icon:glasses[] Overview

Redis can be configured to automatically purge keys as necessary.
If so configured, Redis will only use a maximum amount of memory, and if it nears the limit, remove keys per some criteria.
If there are evicted keys this alert will be triggered.

== icon:bug[] Steps for Debugging

Check if there are any evicted (removed) keys.
The info command displays how many keys were evicted.
If it was configured on purpose and the key should get evicted, it may be necessary to turn this alert off.
