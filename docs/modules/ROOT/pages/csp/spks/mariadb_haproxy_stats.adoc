= How to Access the HAPRoxy Stats Page
:page-aliases: how-tos/haproxy/stats.adoc

HAProxy comes with a https://www.haproxy.com/blog/exploring-the-haproxy-stats-page[stats page] which shows the current state of all front- and backends.
It can be very helpful to have an overview of the state of HAProxy.
To access the stats page of an HAProxy instance, you need to port-forward with `kubectl`.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n $INSTANCE_ID port-forward svc/haproxy-metrics 9000
----

If the command is running you can access the stats page on http://localhost:9000/stats.
