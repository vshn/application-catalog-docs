= Crossplane as Control Plane

== Problem

We need a way to deploy services the Kubernetes way, fully automated and reconciled.

== Proposals

Crossplane::
https://crossplane.io/[Crossplane] describes itself:
+
> Compose cloud infrastructure and services into custom platform APIs. +
> Crossplane is an open source Kubernetes add-on that enables platform teams to assemble infrastructure from multiple vendors, and expose higher level self-service APIs for application teams to consume, without having to write any code.

Helm Charts::
Plain Helm Charts, applied with a Helm controller.

== Decision

Crossplane

== Rationale

We're already using Crossplane and it proves to be working.
