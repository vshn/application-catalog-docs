= Decision on API Design

== Problem

This decision is about how we can achieve a "common look" as defined https://kb.vshn.ch/app-catalog/explanations/why_exists.html#_standard_way_to_provide_services[here].

The ideal way would be, that we can re-use the exact same XRD for each set of services.
For example all implementations for PostgreSQL have exactly the same API for the user.
Due to the nature of the product, not all implementations provide the same functionality.
The set of available features is most likely not the same between most providers.
Also with Crossplane we're a bit limited on what's possible with translating the source API spec into the target API spec.

== Requirements

* APIs for a set of similar services should feel similar
* They should only need minimal configuration for a default case
* We should be able to leverage unique features of the service providers

== Proposals

=== Proposal 1: Use same XRD with provider specific fields

There's exactly one XRD for a set of services.
This XRD contains a minimal set of common parameters, as well as a field for provider specific configurations.

.Example Claim
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: PostgreSQL
metadata:
  name: my-instance
spec:
  parameters:
    name: my-instance
    majorVersion: '14'
    pgSettings: {}
    exoscale:
      plan: hobbyist-2
      type: pg
      maintenance:
        day: 2
        hour: 22
        minute: 0
      backup:
        hour: 20
        minute: 0
    vshn:
      minorVersion: '4'
----

Advantages::

* We can use the same XRD
* Adding new providers to the list is easy

Disadvantages::

* We don't really have a "common look"
* The customer needs to know what the underlying service provider is, even for simple instances

=== Proposal 2: Separate XRDs

This approach will have different XRDs for each provider.
However, they will follow the same structure, as far as possible.
All the toplevel fields will be the same, the differences will be apparent in the sub-fields.
They will also have the same kind, but a different APIVersion.

# Exoscale example
apiVersion: exoscale.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: PostgreSQL
metadata:
  name: my-instance
spec:
  parameters:
    name: my-instance
    service:
      version: '14'
      type: pg
      settings: {}
    size:
      plan: hobbyist-2
    maintenance:
      day: 2
      hour: 22
      minute: 0
    backup:
      hour: 20
      minute: 0

# Converged example
apiVersion: vshn.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: PostgreSQL
metadata:
  name: my-instance
spec:
  parameters:
    name: my-instance
    service:
      version: '14.4'
      settings: {}
      pgbouncer:
        settings: {}
    size:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 8Gi
      disk: 200Gi
      encrypted: true
    maintenance:
      day: 2
      hour: 22
      minute: 0
    backup:
      hour: 20
      minute: 0
----

Advantages::

* Same look between all providers, deploying PostgreSQL to any backend feels familiar
* Specifics can be handled in a sensible way

Disadvantages::

* The user could get confused by objects with the same kind

=== Proposal 3: Composed XRDs

There's a base XRD that handles the common configurations.
All provider specific parameters are put in a separate XRD.

This idea may not be possible with Crossplane, but it's here for completenessâ€™ sake.

.Example Claim
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: PostgreSQL
metadata:
  name: my-instance
spec:
  parameters:
    name: my-instance
    version: '14'
    pgSettings: {}


apiVersion: exoscale.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: PostgreSQLConfig
metadata:
  name: my-instance
spec:
  parameters:
    instanceRef: my-instance
    plan: hobbyist-2
    type: pg
    maintenance:
      day: 2
      hour: 22
      minute: 0
    backup:
      hour: 20
      minute: 0
----

Advantages::

* Clear separation of base and specific configuration parameters

Disadvantages::

* "same look" will only apply to the base XRDs
* Pretty complicated to use for the end-user

=== Proposal 4: Same XRD and Parse the Input

We use the same XRD for every provider.
Most fields are simply strings, and they will then be parsed in the composition.

spec:
  parameters:
    name: my-instance
    # vshn converged might need the minor version, too
    version: '14.4'
    pgSettings: {}
    # we derive the size of the instance from this string
    # custom-$cpu-$memory-$diskspace
    size: custom-2-8-300
    # vshn converged may not have a type
    type: ''
    maintenance:
      day: 2
      hour: 22
      minute: 0
    backup:
      hour: 20
      minute: 0

Advantages::

* Exact same API for all services of the same set

Disadvantages::

* Awkward to use, there needs to be a lot of documentation
* The complexity of the compositions increases drastically with the parsing rules
